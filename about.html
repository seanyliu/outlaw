    <h1>About the 2014 Conference</h1>
    <h2>
      February 1-2, 2014<br />
      Harvard University<br />
      Cambridge, Massachusetts<br />
    </h2>
    <p> 
      2014 marks the 45th anniversary of the Stonewall Riots, and with the historic U.S. Supreme Court rulings in June 2013, this year's conference, "Forty-five
  years since Stonewall...What's next for the LGBTQ movement?" aims to review where we have come since 1969, and the next frontiers and outstanding opportunities for the LGBTQ community.
    </p>
    <p>
      This inaugural conference, organized by students from the various Harvard graduate schools, will bring together the University's students, scholars, and alumni, as well as practitioners and guests from across the country for a weekend of learning, ideating, and networking. The conference keynotes, panels, and small group breakout sessions are designed to explore and address critical issues for the LGBTQ community while special performances and group activities will give attendees the opportunity to connect and socialize meaningfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      We hope you will join us for the 2014 LGBTQ Conference as we start a new tradition!
    </p>
