          <b>John Amaechi</b><br />
          John Amaechi is the first NBA player to speak publicly about being gay. In 2007, three years after retiring from pro basketball, he became one of only six male professional athletes in the four major U.S. sports to come out. He played for the Cleveland Cavaliers, followed by the Orlando Magic and the Utah Jazz. In 2000, Amaechi's memoir, "Man in the Middle" (2007), explores the challenges he faced as a closeted professional athlete.   After the NBA, Amaechi returned to Britain, where he turned to television sportscasting and covered the 2008 Beijing Olympics for the BBC. In Beijing, Amaechi also served as a human rights ambassador for Amnesty International. He appeared on several episodes of "Shirts &amp; Skins," a Logo reality series, where he mentored a gay basketball team and shared his experiences as an out athlete.  Amaechi owns Amaechi Performance Systems. He is a psychologist with a management consulting company specializing in workplace diversity and workplace climate and culture challenges.  Amaechi established the ABC Foundation, which builds sports centers in Britain and encourages children's involvement in sports and their communities.

Mr. Burke recruited over 20 NHL players to create an initial run of PSAs filmed by HBO that were widely televised during games and was instrumental in creating a formal partnership with the NHL that has since expanded to include Major League Soccer.
