    <h1>2014 Speakers</h1>
    <p>The following speakers have been confirmed:</p>
    <p>
      <b>Kenji Yoshino</b><br />
      Kenji Yoshino is the Chief Justice Earl Warren Professor of Constitutional Law at New York University School of Law. Professor Yoshino studied at Harvard College (B.A. in English literature), Oxford (M.Sc as a Rhodes Scholar) and Yale Law School (J.D.). He taught at Yale between 1998 and 2008, becoming the inaugural Guido Calabresi Professor in 2006. A leading scholar of constitutional and anti-discrimination law, Professor Yoshino has been active in shaping the debate on LGBT and other civil rights. In his award-winning book, Covering: The Hidden Assault on Our Civil Rights, Professor Yoshino explores what he describes as "the civil rights issue of our time": the pressures on minorities to "cover" their identities, downplaying traits that mark them as different in order to assimilate into the mainstream. Professor Yoshino will discuss recent research conducted with Christie Smith on demands LGBT minorities face to cover their identities or “act straight” in the workplace.
